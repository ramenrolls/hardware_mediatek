# Mediatek Hardware Support

This section details the integration of Mediatek hardware support through the PixelExperience-Blobs vendor implementation.

* **Efficiency:** By binding the three PixelExperience-Blobs repositories (`vendor_mediatek_ims`, `vendor_mediatek_interfaces`, and `vendor_mediatek_opensource`), streamline the setup and ensure compatibility

**Repository Bindings:**

* `vendor_mediatek_ims`: Provides essential IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) functionalities for features like VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and ViLTE (Video over LTE).
* `vendor_mediatek_interfaces`: Offers hardware-specific interfaces for optimal interaction between the software and Mediatek components.
* `vendor_mediatek_opensource`: Contains open-source components required for Mediatek hardware support.
